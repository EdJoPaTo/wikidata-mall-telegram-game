    Keep in mind we are using 📎 as our currency.
    Some skills and tools might come in handy when handling these. 🙃


    One special skill is the collector.
    In contrast to the other skills you can skill it per shop you own.
    The total level will influence your throughput per item.
    This includes the levels for shops you don't even own anymore.


    The skill queue will allow you to add skills which starts within 12 hours.
    You can also reset your skill queue (but not the one currently in training).
